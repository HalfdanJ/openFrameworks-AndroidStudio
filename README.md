**Android Studio is now officially supported in [openFrameworks 090](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/android-studio/)**

This is a set of project files to make it possible to use OpenFrameworks with Android Studio.

# Installation

1. Install and configure Android Studio
2. Install the Android NDK somewhere
3. Download and unpack OpenFrameworks
4. Copy the files from this repository over top of the OpenFrameworks files, merging directories
    (i.e. replace existing files, but do not replace entire directories)
5. Open this directory as a project in Android Studio (use File->Open and select this directory)
6. Set `ndk.dir` in the `local.properties` to the full path to your Android NDK
7. Build and run the example app

# Usage

To create new projects:

1. Copy the provided example app (make sure to put it in a subdirectory of `apps`, at the same level as the sample)
2. Double-click on `build.gradle` and press "Add Now..."
3. If that doesn't work, add the project to `settings.gradle` manually.
4. Perform a project sync (it should prompt you to do this).

To create projects from existing examples:

1. Copy the `build.gradle` file from `androidEmptyExample` into the examples directory.
2. Follow steps 2-4 above.

# Troubleshooting

- You may need to adjust the following numbers to match your installed Android Studio and Android SDK.
Android Studio should offer to fix these values for you when you open the appropriate build files.

    - The Gradle version specified in `/build.gradle`
    - The `compileSdkVersion`, `buildToolsVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion` values
        in `/addons/ofxAndroid/ofAndroidLib/build.gradle` and `/apps/myApps/androidEmptyExample/build.gradle`

- If you get strange linker errors (e.g. errors about a missing `__srget`), try using the r9d version
of the NDK. Newer NDKs (particularly r10c and up) don't work with some versions of OpenFrameworks.

- Getting a manifest merge error involving `ic_launcher`? Try replacing `addons/ofxAndroid/ofAndroidLib/AndroidManifest.xml` with
the one from this repository, or just deleting the `<application>` tag from that file.
